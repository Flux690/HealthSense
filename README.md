# HealthSense
HealthSense is a deep learning tool designed to streamline Alzheimer's diagnosis by classifying MRI images. It offers a faster and more accurate alternative to traditional methods, which can be slow and prone to errors. By leveraging the ResNet50 model, HealthSense enhances early detection, crucial for effective treatment.

To run the application code, follow these steps:

1. Use Kaggle: Run the code on Kaggle, not Colab, as Kaggle offers better GPU runtime and more RAM.
2. Enable GPU Acceleration: Go to Notebook Settings on the right side of the Kaggle console and enable GPU acceleration.
3. Access the Dataset: Open the dataset from this link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/Alzheimer-mri-dataset), click "New Notebook" on the top right, and import the provided Jupyter notebook.
4. Alternative Option: You can also unzip the dataset to your drive and manually upload it to Kaggle. Note that uploading might take time due to the dataset's large size.
5. Run the Notebook: Start the notebook and execute the code cells sequentially.

Note: You may need to adjust the dataset path in the code. To do this on Kaggle, hover over the dataset on the right side and click the "Copy location" button.

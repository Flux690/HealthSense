Hello. This is our Project on Alzheimer's Disease Classification and detection using CNN.

In order to run the application code, you need to follow the given steps-

1. The code need to be run on Kaggle & not on Collab due to a better GPU runtime and more RAM comparatively.
2. GPU Acceleration can be enabled under Notebook Settings available on right hand side of the console on Kaggle.
3. Open the dataset from the given link 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/Alzheimer-mri-dataset', click on 'New Notebook' option on top right hand side and import the given Jupyter notebook.
4. Alternatively, you can unzip the given dataset on drive and upload it explicitly on Kaggle while working on the notebook. (The dataset uploading may take time due to large size)
4. Start the notebook, and run the given code cells one by one.

NOTE- You may need to change the dataset path in the code when working on kaggle. Just hover on dataset on Right Side and Hit Copy location button.
